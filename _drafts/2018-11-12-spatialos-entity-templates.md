## What

I created a system for specifying entity templates in SpatialOS. 

## Why

Two flows, creating Entities and Creating corresponding GameObjects, useful to have those two flows in the same place.

## How

Used the UI and ScriptableObject method that is also used by Unity's Post Processing Stack v2.
