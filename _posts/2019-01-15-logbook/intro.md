For the past year and a half I've been working on a prototype for a game, working title _"Garbage Country"_. It is an experiment with persistent multiplayer mechanics (using SpatialOS). In other words: a game where players can make permanent changes in a shared world.

Starting a few months ago I've had serious doubts about the direction I should take it in. These doubts were made worse by the fact that programming a multiplayer game comes with a certain amount of friction. Quickly experimenting with gameplay features is harder when you're also trying to make those features work across the network. Regardless, along the way I learned a lot about workflow, prototyping, networked games, and a bunch of other topics.

Last Thursday, a dispute between SpatialOS and Unity reignited my doubts in a serious way. It has made me decide to put the project down, at least for a little while. To make it feel like my time was somewhat well spent, and to have some sort of 'product' from the period, I am uploading the logbooks that I kept during development. They are very chaotic. I am honestly embarrased about how badly I am capable of planning and working in a goal-oriented way. Then again, it's also a creative process and I love the freedom of letting the experiment lead me on a day-by-day basis. At best, you might feel better about your own style of note-keeping and organisation.

### Stop reading if you do not like ranty opinions.

Because this situation affected me personally and made me feel some emotions, I am going to be unwise and speculate about what is going on. So. Unity uses a per-developer license for its Editor, unlike the Unreal Engine, for which you pay a percentage of revenue of the games made with it. In Unity's case, this means you could build a game with 10 developers and pay for 10 licenses. If the game is a hit and is played by millions of montly-paying gamers, Unity would get no part of that pie except for the 10 licenses bought by the company. Unity feels like they are missing out on a piece of that pie. Between businesses, I do not think there is such a thing as _fair_. There are just the rules of capitalism. Whether I think *capitalism* is fair is another story. So I don't think that Unity "deserves" a piece of any pie. I do understand that Unity _wants_ a piece of the pie, inasmuch as that every corporation wants a piece of every pie.

Huge sales are not specific to online games, but online games are the future that Unity is betting on. To get a piece of that pie, Unity is doing two things. *One*: they are trying to 'partner' with providers of online games. *Two*: they are launching their own solution for online games.

What I do not like is the fact that Unity is wielding their power to set back the competition when this 'partnering' doesn't work out, and is affecting developers in the process. I will not argue that SpatialOS is some kind of underdog, but they are building a great product, and something that is legitimately innovative. Even if Unity is launching a great service as well, it is hard to see how their latest move (as reported by Improbable) has the developer's interests at heart. This all of course hinges on the *assumption* that 'partnering up' as mentioned by Unity consists of getting money.

Personally, I'd rather see Unity switch to a revenue-share model and be transparent about it (like Unreal), because I never want to be surprised by such a dispute again. I also do not like to be shoe-horned into Unity's ecosystem of sometimes-mediocre peripheral products. Having said all this, the Unity team has made some amazing improvements to the editor lately, and I love using it more and more, they are visibly investing money and effort into their core product too. Ironically, if Improbable and Unity can't be friends, it might be likely that I'll stick with Unity than the other way around.
