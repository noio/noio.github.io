This is the original **Kingdom Flash game** released in 2013. It's still a lot of fun but we've since polished it and expanded this into a real game.

## [Get the full game on Steam!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/368230)

A very minimal strategy game that encourages you to stop and enjoy the scenery every now and then. I should thank [PEZ (soundcloud)](http://soundcloud.com/pez_pez) for the perfect music, go check it out.

I have released the source code and assets on [GitHub](http://github.com/noio/kingdom). You could use the sprites and animations to build an entirely different game. They are located in [/assets/gfx](https://github.com/noio/kingdom/tree/master/assets/gfx), including the samples shown below.
