Yesterday [Popobawa](http://www.sc2mapster.com/profiles/Popobawa/) and me released our map for Starcraft II, called Dixel's TD. It's a remake of a classic WCIII map of the same name.

The goal of the map is to beat all 26 waves as fast as possible. You can do this by building your maze at the start of the lane. However, monsters lose health gradually as they walk through the lane, so when you build at the front, you have to take down the strongest monsters. Building at the back is safer, but you will be a lot slower.

You have to take into account the different kinds of monsters that spawn, in order to build a maze that is effective against each wave.

It's published on the EU battle.net servers, so go ahead and give it a try! Just search for "dixel".
