I didn't do a lot of work on this site, it was already perfectly designed, all it needed was an update of the code. I fixed mouse-over effects for the buttons on the left, but left the site's content pages easy to understand and edit. All the content pages are simple HTML pages inside an iFrame. I also had to implement a slightly modified version of lytebox, this version allowed for descriptions under each image. You can find the site [here](http://mingming.nl).
