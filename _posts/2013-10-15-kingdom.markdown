This game was built to look nice and pixely. I have released the source code and assets on [GitHub](http://github.com/noio/kingdom). You could use the sprites and animations to make a better game than I did ;). They are located in [/assets/gfx](https://github.com/noio/kingdom/tree/master/assets/gfx), including the samples shown below.
