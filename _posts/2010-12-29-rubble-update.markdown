So I'm still working on a little flash game. It's a game where you play a tank and make your way through some levels where aliens will try to blow you up while you solve the physics puzzles. I thought I'd do a little update, partly for your enjoyment, partly for my motivation. To start you off, here are some screenshots.

I also did some music snippets for each level in the game. One of them, for the first level, is below.
