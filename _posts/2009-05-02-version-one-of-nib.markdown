It's been quite a while since the last update on my plugin, Noio Iconized Bookmarks, but yesterday I decided to add all the features I had been wanting to add ever since its release. 

[![Screenshot of the Settings Panel](http://www.noio.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-1-240x180.png)](http://www.noio.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/screenshot-1.png)

The biggest new feature is the interface, you can now preview all found favicons before adding them to your database! The interface also allows you to select which favicons you want to use, or select (and preview) custom favicons! Go to the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/noio-iconized-bookmarks/) to get the latest version! Also, please let me know if you have any bugs or issues, and I can include fixes and changes for version 1.1. 

Above you can see a screenshot of the new admin panel, as you can see, there are options to select the favicon for each link, and you can pick the default favicon or enter a custom image address. The new version should be really simple to use, and require no explanation except for the info on the settings panel.
