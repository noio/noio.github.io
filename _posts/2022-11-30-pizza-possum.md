This last year, I built a small game with [Friedemann](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@friedemann). We set ourselves a tight schedule and were originally hoping to ship something within 6 months. It took us a few months extra to settle on the right concept. It's a nice feeling to compress development into a short period like that. It forces you to discard a lot of the conceptual doubts that come with a longer project and just keep pushing forward.

It's not quite decided when and where the game will be released, so keep an eye out!
