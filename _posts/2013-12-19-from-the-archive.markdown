Going through my projects folder, I came across some beginnings of games I had totally 
forgotten about. I thought it would be nice to go through these projects and take 
screenshots and movies to remind me what they actually look like. I'll share three of them.

### Amsterdam

These are some typical Dutch houses that I thought would make a nice scenery. They are 
actually procedurally generated and colored based on prefab blocks.  I have no 
idea where to go with this. Most of the "tech" (e.g. the reflections) made it into 
[Kingdom](/2013/10/kingdom). And I even did a little GVB tram.

### Pseudo-3D Tank

I started a little 2.5D rendering engine in Flixel using sprites built up from "stacked" 
and transformed layers. It has a neat look but it's probably going to be a headache at
some point down the road.

### Autumn in Space

Something about riding a bike through zombies in front of an incredibly dull grey sky. 
Really, #AFB4C2?
But it does have neat parallax for the road and dynamic shadows! If this game is ever made,
it should play the [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJ0793-qiA) of the same title.
