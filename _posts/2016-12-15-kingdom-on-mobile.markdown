So, I realize that this blog/portfolio thing is a wasteland, even though people still find their way here looking for some Kingdom news. For the latest status, just ping me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/noionl). But I'll leave a little update here too. 

So Kingdom is definitely soon coming to mobile, more than a year after the Steam release. I think it's a good thing that I've had this period to really polish the game, making sure that mobile will be less of a testing ground than Steam was.

As you know, developers are always careful with mentioning dates, but Kingdom: New Lands will most likely hit Android and iOS early in 2017. The build is running really well on newer devices, and we're currently seeing how far we can stretch performance.
