## Description

GARBAGE COUNTRY is a vehicle exploration and tower defense game set in a vast, post-industrial wasteland. Players drive through a handcrafted open world, scavenging abandoned landmarks, upgrading their vehicle, and fending off waves of derelict bots while uncovering the remnants of a world left behind.

The project was born from a simple idea: seeing players drawn into the quiet, overgrown worlds of Cloud Gardens, but wanting to engage with it on a deeper level.\
So I thought: What if you could drive through it?

We set out to create iconic post-industrial landmarks, combining atmospheric exploration with vehicle platforming and strategic tower defense.
At its core, Garbage Country invites players to lose themselves in the world's quiet decay, uncovering its mechanics and mysteries at their own pace.
